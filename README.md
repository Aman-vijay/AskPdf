# AskPDF 

A  web application that allows users to upload and interact with PDF documents through an intelligent chat interface. Designed to provide a seamless experience for reading, understanding, and querying documents using AI.

Built using React Js, Node.js/Express, and Google Gemini API, the app implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for highly relevant and contextual answers.

##  Overview

This project is a similar to Google NotebookLM clone that allows users to:
- Upload large PDF files (up to 10MB)
- Interact with documents through an intelligent chat interface
- Receive efficient responses with minimal token usage
- Navigate documents through clickable citations
- Uses LlamaParse for advanced PDF parsing; falls back to pdf-parse for reliability. Gemini handles both response generation and embeddings.

## Features

Document Management

 - Upload large PDF files (up to 10MB)

 - View documents directly in-browser

 - See upload progress and file metadata

 - Delete documents when no longer needed

 AI-Powered Chat

 - Ask questions about your PDFs

- Answers include clickable citations pointing to exact page numbers

- Suggested follow-up questions for deeper exploration

 Smart Search

- Embedding-based semantic search for locating relevant sections


 Optimized Processing

- Fast PDF parsing with LlamaParse or fallback to pdf-parse

- Smart text chunking with overlaps for context preservation

- Vector embedding via Google Gemini Embedding API

- Asynchronous and memory-efficient architecture

##  Usage Flow

1. **Upload PDF**: Users upload a PDF document through the interface
2. **Processing**: Backend extracts text, creates chunks, and generates embeddings
3. **AI Suggestions**: System generates relevant questions based on document content
4. **Interactive Chat**: Users ask questions about the document
5. **Intelligent Responses**: AI provides answers with citations and page references
6. **Citation Navigation**: Users click citations to navigate to specific pages
